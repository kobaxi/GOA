    <p>Huddle re-imagines the way we build communities. You have a voice, but so does your audience. Create connections with your users as you engage in genuine discussion.</p>
    
    <h1 class="h1">Build The Community Your Fans Will Love</h1>
    <h1 class="h2">Grow Together</h1>
    <p> Generate meaningful discussions with your audience and build a strong, loyal community. Think of the insightful conversations you miss out on with a feedback form.</p>
    <h1 class="h3">Flowing Conversations</h1>
    <h1 class="h4">Your Users</h1>
    <p>    You wouldn't paginate a conversation in real life, so why do it online?
        Our threads have just-in-time loading for a more natural flow.</p>
    <p>It takes no time at all to integrate Huddle with your app's authentication solution. This means, once signed in to your app, your users can start chatting immediately.</p>
